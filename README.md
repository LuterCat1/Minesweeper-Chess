A chess variant that includes Minesweeper mechanics.

# Rules
(I explain it poorly, so watch this video [HERE](https://www.tiktok.com/@viper_chess/video/7474859288641539371) – he explains it much better!)

# Credits 😔
[@viper_chess](https://www.tiktok.com/@viper_chess) – He gave me the idea for the game!

[@mxazerradj](https://www.tiktok.com/@mxazerradj) – He gave me the idea to actually code the game!

ChatGPT – Helped fix bugs and made my messy code clearer for humans to understand.

# ⚠️ Play vs Bot ⚠️
**Play vs Bot** is EXTREMELY buggy, and the bot is pretty stupid.

# Bug Fixes
I'm too lazy to fix the bugs. There are tons of them. I did this project because I was bored, and my Marvel Rivals was updating.
